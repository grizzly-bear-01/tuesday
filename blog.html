      <h2>What is the difference in <i>map</i>, <i>filter</i>, <i>forEach</i>, and <i>find</i>?</h2>

      <p>All four functions - map, filter, forEach, and find - are built-in methods in
        JavaScript that can be
        used with
        arrays to perform various operations on their elements. Here are the differences between them:</p>
      <p><b>map:</b> map method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. The
        function
        returns a new value, and that value is used to create a new array. The length of the new array will always be
        the same as the original array.
        <br> Example:
      <pre>const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          const newArr = arr.map((num) => num * 2);
          console.log(newArr); 

          // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</pre>
      </p>
      <p><b>filter:</b> filter method creates a new array by filtering out the elements that do not meet the criteria
        specified
        in a function. The function returns a Boolean value, and only the elements for which the function returns true
        are included in the new array.
        <br> Example:
      <pre>const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          const newArr = arr.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
          console.log(newArr); 

          // [2, 4]</pre>
      </p>
      <p><b>forEach:</b> forEach method applies a function to each element of an array, but it does not create a new
        array. It
        simply iterates over the array and executes the provided function for each element.
        <br> Example:

      <pre>const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          arr.forEach((num) => console.log(num));
          
          // 1
          // 2
          // 3
          // 4
          // 5</pre>
      </p>
      <p><b>find:</b> find method returns the first element in an array that satisfies the specified condition in a
        function. If
        no elements satisfy the condition, it returns undefined.
        <br> Example:
      <pre>const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
          const result = arr.find((num) => num > 3);
          console.log(result);

          // 4</pre>
      </p>
      <p>map and filter both create new arrays, while forEach does not create a new array, and find returns the
        first element that satisfies the specified condition. </p>

      <h2>What is the difference in <i>LocalStorage</i>, <i>SessionStorage</i>, and <i>cookies</i>?</h2>
      <p>LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and cookies are ways that web developers can store information in a user's web
        browser using JavaScript.</p>

      <p>Think of it like a little box where you can put things in and take them out later. Cookies are like a small box
        that you can only use for a little while. SessionStorage is like a bigger box that you can use for a longer
        time, but it goes away when you close your web browser. LocalStorage is like a big box that you can use for a
        really long time, even after you close your web browser.</p>

      <p>So, if you want to store some information that you only need for a short time, like a username or a shopping
        cart, you can use cookies. If you want to store some information that you need for a longer time, like a user's
        preferences, you can use SessionStorage. If you want to store information that you need for a really long time,
        like a user's login information, you can use LocalStorage.</p>

      <h2>How does <i>event loop</i> work?</h2>
      <p>Imagine you're playing a video game where you have to collect coins and avoid obstacles. You press the arrow
        keys to move your character, and you can only move one step at a time. Now imagine that the video game has to
        handle other things too, like playing sound effects and keeping track
        of your score. All of these things are happening at the same time, but your character can only move one step
        at a time.</p>

      <p>This is a bit like how JavaScript works. JavaScript is a programming language used to create websites and web
        applications. When you visit a website, the JavaScript code on that website is constantly running in the
        background, handling things like user interactions, animations, and network requests. The problem is that
        JavaScript can only do one thing at a time, just like your character in the video game can only move one step
        at a time. So how does JavaScript handle all of the different things that need to happen at the same time?
        Enter the Event Loop. The Event Loop is like the traffic cop of the JavaScript world. It makes sure that
        everything gets done in the right order, without anything getting stuck or delayed.</p>

      <p>Here's how it works: Whenever an event happens in JavaScript (like a button click or a network request), the
        Event Loop adds that event to a queue. The queue is like a waiting line for events. Meanwhile, the JavaScript
        code continues to run, doing whatever it needs to do. When it's done, the Event Loop checks the queue to see
        if there are any events waiting to be processed. If there are, the Event Loop takes the first event in the
        queue and processes it. Once the event is done, the Event Loop goes back to the queue and takes the next
        event, and so on. This process continues indefinitely, with events being added to the queue and processed in
        the order they were added.</p>

      <p>So, just like how you move your character one step at a time in the video game, JavaScript handles events one
        at a time using the Event Loop. This ensures that everything gets done in the right order, without anything
        getting stuck or delayed.</p>

        <h2>What does the function <i>quizTimer</i> do in noChange.js file?</h2>
        <p>The function <i>quizTimer</i> sets a timer that increments a count by 1 every second. It then displays the
          count in
          the format of minutes and seconds, and updates the HTML content of an element with the ID count. The
          <i>covtMin</i>
          variable calculates the minutes and the mod variable calculates the remaining seconds. The <i>min</i> and
          <i>countSec</i>
          variables add leading zeros to the minutes and seconds respectively, to ensure that they are always displayed
          in a consistent format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The if <i>(count > 60)</i> condition checks if the timer has been running for more than 60 seconds. If it has,
          it
          changes the color of the text in the <i>countHtml</i> element every 2 seconds to make it more noticeable to
          the user.
          If the dismiss parameter is passed to the function as true, the <i>clearInterval()</i> function is called to
          stop the
          timer. This can be used to stop the timer when it is no longer needed. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What does the function <i>chooseQuiz</i> do in noChange.js file?</h2>
        <p>The function <i>chooseQuiz</i> updates or adds an object to an array of quiz answers, and then displays the
          updated
          array of answers. </p>
        <p>The function takes two arguments: <i>index</i> and <i>givenAns</i>. It then checks if there is an object in
          the answers
          array that has the same id property as the <i>quizData</i> object at the specified index. If such an object
          exists,
          the function replaces that object in the answers array with a new object that has the same properties as the
          <i>quizData</i> object at the specified index, but with the <i>givenAns</i> property set to the
          <i>givenAns</i> argument.
        </p>
        <p>If there is no object in the answers array with the same id property as the <i>quizData</i> object at the
          specified
          index, the function creates a new object with the properties of the <i>quizData</i> object at the specified
          index, as
          well as the <i>givenAns</i> property, and pushes it to the answers array. After adding or updating the object
          in the
          answers array, the function calls the <i>displayAnswers</i> function, passing in the answers array as an
          argument.
